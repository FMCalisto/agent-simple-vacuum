# Vacuum Simple Agent

## Aim

The "agent" paradigm has rapidly become one of the major conceptual frameworks for understanding and structuring research activities within Artificial Intelligence. In addition, many implementational frameworks are being introduced and used both in research and industry to control the complexity of sophisticated distributed software systems where the nodes exhibit behviors often associated with intelligent behavior.

The purpose with this lab is to introduce the agent concept and allow you to implement a search functionality which can then be evaluated relative to a vacuum cleaning agent application.

The lab consists of two parts. In the first you will familiarize yourselves with the software agent environment and world simulator. In the second part you will implement a search algorithm which can be used by the agent to provide cleaning capabilities in the vacuum cleaning world.
